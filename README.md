# Energy-trading

The aim of this Git repository is to provide a simple implementation of an energy trading system. It is used in the XXX paper.

The idea is to demonstrate that Blockchain can be a realistic and usable solution for implementing end-user energy dispatch systems. The idea is also to highlight the fact that different Blockchains can be considered for this purpose, and that it is therefore independent of the underlying technology. However, as the data storage structure differs between the technologies, there are differences in implementation between what is proposed with Hyperledger Fabric and what is proposed with Ethereum.

We therefore propose: 1) an implementation of the system based on Hyperledger Fabric (ChainCode) and another based on Ethereum (Smart Contract), both accompanied by a graphical interface (User Interface) 2) mechanisms to easily deploy the proposed solutions (using Docker containers).
