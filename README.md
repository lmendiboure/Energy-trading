# Energy-trading

The aim of this Git repository is to provide a simple implementation of an energy trading system. It is used in the XXX paper.

We therefore propose: 1) an implementation of the system based on Hyperledger Fabric (ChainCode) and another based on Ethereum (Smart Contract), both accompanied by a graphical interface (User Interface) 2) mechanisms to easily deploy the proposed solutions (using Docker containers).
